## Executive Summary

### Research

   * Leading a team that has demonstrated subsystem components for
            space division multiplexed communication systems, in particular the
            first photonic lantern based wavelength selective switch. 
    * Leading a team that demonstrated wavelength resolved measurement
            techniques for imaging through multi-mode fibres, including a
            demonstration of optimal imaging through the fibre.
    * First demonstration of Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith states by principle
            modes in multi-mode fibre.
    * Emulation of multi-output interferometric circuits using
            LCOS-based wavelength selective switches, which has now been 
            included in the product of our industry partner.
    * Linear and nonlinear optical signal processing for manipulating
            and monitoring ultra-high bandwidth telecom signals.
    * All optical discrete Fourier transform filter for multiplexing
            and demultiplexing of OFDM signals.
    * Universal transmitter for rapid prototyping and flexible signal
            generation.
    * The first mode-locked Raman fibre laser above 1~GHz repetition
            rate. And the first wavelength, pulse-shape and repetition rate
            tunable mode-locked laser.
    * The first demonstration of phase-sensitive amplification in a
            $\chi^{(3)}$ photonic chip, and subsequently the first
            demonstration of phase-sensitive amplification in a record short
            silicon photonic crystal waveguide. 

### Industry Collaboration

    Chief investigator and project leader on an ARC
    industry linkage grant with Finisar. \emph{Technology transfer} of my work to
    create multi-output transfer functions to Finisar, this is now part of their
    application suite for the WaveShaper product.

    invited papers at renowned international conferences such as OFC, CLEO, OECC and others. 
    Inventor on two full patents.

### Supervision

    (Co)-supervised five PhD students (three completed, two current), one master, 12 honours students and several undergraduate students.

### Outreach, Education and Training

    Establishment of the CUDOS
Entrepreneurship Seminar Series and the CUDOS Entrepreneurship Scholarship

### Leadership 

 One year CUDOS Tbit/s Project Leader. Two years Chief
    Investigator and project leader for ARC Linkage grant supervising one
postdoc. Two years CUDOS Director of Training and Education.

### Teaching 

  Four years teaching experience. Course Coordinator for final year capstone projects,
    significant remodelling to make experience more relevant. Course
    Coordinator for Communications Engineering 2, modernisation of course
content.
